The [troika-examples package](https://github.com/protectwise/troika/tree/master/packages/troika-examples) contains several example scenes. These are intended to demonstrate a wide range of Troika's capabilities and some interesting techniques that it enables.


## Viewing the examples

The examples from the latest master branch are published automatically at [https://troika-examples.netlify.com](https://troika-examples.netlify.com).


## Running the examples

You can run the examples yourself from the source code. First check out the source from GitHub and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/protectwise/troika.git
cd troika
npm install
```

Then run the examples:

```
npm run examples
```

This will build the examples into a bundle and serve up the result at [http://localhost:10001]. Point your browser there and you'll see the examples in action. It will also watch the files for changes so you can fiddle with things and reload the browser to see them in action.
